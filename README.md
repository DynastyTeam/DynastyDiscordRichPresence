# Dynasty's Discord Rich Presence - SOON

With this program you can create a custom Discord Rich Presence (aka status).

Note: Discord already has it's own build-in Rich Presence, this is just allowing you to have a custom Discord Rich Presence.

## Installation

* [Download](https://github.com/DynastyTeam/DynastyDiscordRichPresence/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and run the program.
* Set your custom status.
* Press start.
* All set!.

Note: The program must be running in order to display the custom Discord Rich Presence. You may stop the program or close the window to stop the custom Rich Presence.
